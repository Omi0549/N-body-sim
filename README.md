# N-body-sim
This is my Python project which is to simulate an n-body simulation with certain conditions and questions.
To run this program you'll need to first install the first program which is simply just one line of code that helps in installing pygame to your Python environment.
After installing pygame you can then run the second code which is named 'FinalProject_2'
You can input whatever values for the number of particles and their respective masses...
Enjoy :)
